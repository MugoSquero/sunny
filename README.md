### Demo

[![Demo](./assets/demo.svg)](./assets/demo.svg)


### Motivation

Sunny is hugely inspired by [SoundScrape](https://github.com/Miserlou/SoundScrape), the main motivation  for writing this was speed and customizability.

- SoundScrape downloads sequentially whereas Sunny does parallelly, giving a huge boost of speed.
- Track format can be customized.

### Format
By default files are saved in this structure in current directory if `--path` option is not passed.

```
