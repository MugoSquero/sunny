### Demo

[![Demo](./assets/demo.gif)](./assets/demo.gif)

### Motivation

Sunny is hugely inspired by [SoundScrape](https://github.com/Miserlou/SoundScrape), the main motivation for writing this was speed and customizability.

- SoundScrape downloads sequentially whereas Sunny does parallelly, giving a huge boost of speed.
- Track format can be customized.

### Format

By default files are saved in this structure in current directory if `--path` option is not passed.

```
Artist
  â”œâ”€â”€ Album
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 01 - Track.mp3
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 02 - Track.mp3
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 03 - Track.mp3
  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 04 - Track.mp3
```
